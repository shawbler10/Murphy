Murphy - Your AI Onboarding Buddy
Murphy is an intelligent, friendly, and proactive AI-powered companion designed to streamline the onboarding process for new hires. It aims to transform a potentially overwhelming experience into an engaging, supportive, and efficient journey, ensuring every new team member feels welcomed, informed, and ready to contribute from day one.

üéØ The Problem
Traditional onboarding can be fragmented and impersonal. New hires are often inundated with documents, unsure of who to ask for simple questions, and struggle to understand company culture and unwritten rules. This can lead to:

Slower ramp-up time and productivity loss.

Increased anxiety and confusion for the new hire.

A heavy, repetitive burden on HR staff, managers, and teammates.

‚ú® The Solution: Murphy
Murphy acts as a 24/7 personal guide for new employees. By leveraging the power of a Large Language Model (like the Gemini API), it provides instant, accurate, and context-aware answers to a wide range of questions, from "Where do I find the benefits enrollment form?" to "What's the best place to get coffee near the office?"

Key Features
ü§ñ Conversational Q&A: Get instant answers to questions about HR policies, company tools, team members, and cultural norms.

‚úÖ Personalized Task Checklists: Murphy delivers a dynamic onboarding plan, guiding new hires through their Day 1, Week 1, and Month 1 tasks.

üóìÔ∏è Smart Calendar Integration: Proactively reminds new hires about important meetings, 1:1s, and training sessions. It can even suggest talking points!

ü§ù Team & Culture Introductions: Provides friendly introductions to key team members and shares insights into the company's culture and values.

üß† Context-Aware Support: Murphy learns from company documentation (Confluence, Google Drive, etc.) to provide answers that are always up-to-date and relevant.

üí¨ Seamless Integration: Designed to live where you work, with integrations for Slack, Microsoft Teams, and email.
